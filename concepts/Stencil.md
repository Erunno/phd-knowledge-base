wiki - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_Stencil_Loops

class of algorithms
performs actions on 2D/3D grid (most commonly)
- actions are performed in loop - **Iterative Stencil Loops**Â (ISLs)
- during one iteration a same actions performed for all the cells of the grid - and their close neighborhood
	- common stencils - 7-point, 27-point (for 3D) ...
Conway's game of live can be regarded as stencil algorithm
